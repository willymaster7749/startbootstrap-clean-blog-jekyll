哇喔，弄了好久終於用好了。

其實我一直想要用一個這樣的 blog，但是因為一些莫名其妙的原因就一直延宕下去。上學期修了網路服務程式設計這個課，教我們怎麼用
html、css 那些東西架設網站，所以算是有了一些基礎；最近大家又都在汲汲營營的投履歷實習，搞得人心惶惶，我也心頭一驚：欸？我是
不是該來把這個一直以來的想法實踐一下？  
先是比較了各個平台，最後還是覺得用 github pages 最實在。之後研究了 jekyll 老半天，碰到了一堆 MAC os 的問題，找了一堆資料
才順利解決。

希望我會勤奮不懈的更新下去...就看我能不能成為超級無敵部落客了

    Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and
    evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about
    technological dangers also come from science.

    What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot
    on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

    A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing
    her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I
    felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and
    cherish her.

    For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and
    perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your
    perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable
    than those which divide us.

    There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both
    figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no
    matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just
    beginning.

    Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even
    a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in
    accordance with the natural laws of human development.

    As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.
    Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can
    imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,
    that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing
    this has to change a man.

    Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
    Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life
    and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

    As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of
    realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and
    this is exploration at its greatest.
